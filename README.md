Part 1 I went over and beyond the scope of the class and experimented with Python classes in my code.  I did this because I wanted to create separate instances of the game and guesses in order to maintain separation of data in memory for the script running simultaneously on one machine.

I was disappointed to find that the networking notes were of little use, and the code itself did not work for the server side.  I found online resources that were more helpful.  Otherwise an interesting part of the project.
